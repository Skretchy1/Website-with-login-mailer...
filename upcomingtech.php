                  This is a thing that is right on the brink of being a real thing.<br>
                  We already have smart appliances such as refrigerators that will <br>
                  tell you when you're low on a certain food item or an oven you <br>
                  can control with your smartphone. Sometime in the near future <br>
                  these things will be aggregated into an entire home unit that <br>
                  you'll be able to control with your smartphone, tablet, or computer. <br>
                  We're talking changing the thermostat, changing the channel on TV, <br>
                  and getting notifications that your laundry is ready all without <br>
                  leaving your couch. You can preheat the oven for dinner as you leave <br>
                  work so it's ready to cook when you get home. It won't be too much <br>
                  longer before your house talks to you and you can talk to it. The tech <br>
                  is already there, it's just a matter of putting it all together in a <br>
                  stable enough manner for consumers.

              Wearable sports bands that measure your heart rate are nothing new, but <br>
              as numerous studies have shown, the accuracy can vary wildly (especially <br>
              if you rely on them to count calories). In general, that's fine if you <br>
              just want an idea of how hard you're working out, but for professionals, <br>
              accuracy is everything.
            
              Using a single lead ECG printed into the fabric, this new t-shirt from <br>
              smart materials company KYMIRA will accurately measure heart beats and upload <br>
              them to the cloud via Bluetooth. Once there, algorithms process the data to <br>
              accurately detect irregular heartbeats such as arrhythmia heart beats, which <br>
              could prove life saving.
              
              And it's not just athletes who could benefit. “The possibilities this product <br>
              offers both sportspeople and the general public is astonishing,” says Tim Brownstone, <br>
              CEO and founder of KYMIRA. “We envisage developing this product to be used for clinical <br>
              applications to allow those who may already suffer with heart conditions enough warning <br>
              of a heart attack.”<br>
